# Face Recognition Project

## Overview
This project is a facial recognition system developed using MATLAB, designed to identify and differentiate between multiple individuals based on their facial features. The project employs three distinct neural networks, which were trained to perform facial recognition tasks with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Multi-Network Architecture:** Utilizes three separate trained neural networks for robust recognition.
- **Efficient Performance:** Optimized for high accuracy and low latency.
- **Scalability:** The system can be expanded to include more facial data for additional users.

## Requirements
### Software
- MATLAB (Tested on version compatible with Neural Network Toolbox)
- Octave (as an open-source alternative to MATLAB, for loading and processing .mat files)

### Dependencies
- MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox

### Files Included
1. `all3Networks.mat` - Contains the three trained neural networks.
2. `network1.mat`, `network2.mat`, `network3.mat` - Individual files for each neural network.
3. `faceRecognitionScript.m` - The main script for running the facial recognition process.
4. Sample images and data for testing the recognition system.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shm0m/Face-ID.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Face-ID
   ```

3. Open MATLAB or Octave and load the neural network files:
   ```matlab
   load('network1.mat');
   load('network2.mat');
   load('network3.mat');
   ```

4. Run the main script:
   ```matlab
   run('faceRecognitionScript.m');
   ```

## How It Works
1. The system captures or loads facial images.
2. Preprocessing is applied to the images (resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization).
3. The processed images are passed through the three neural networks for recognition.
4. Outputs from the networks are aggregated to determine the final prediction.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing real-time face recognition with a webcam.
- Enhancing the modelâ€™s robustness against different lighting conditions and angles.
- Integrating with cloud storage for scalable user data.
